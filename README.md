Capstone Project: Statistical Analysis of Advertising Platforms

Project Overview:

This project evaluates the performance of advertising platforms (Facebook vs AdWords) in driving conversions for marketing campaigns. Through statistical analysis and predictive modeling, the study provides actionable insights to optimize ad spend and maximize returns.

Week-by-Week Breakdown

Week 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

-Conducted descriptive statistical analysis of clicks and conversions, including mean, median, and mode.

-Analyzed variability using standard deviations.

-Visualized relationships with scatter plots and contingency tables.

-Found a positive correlation between clicks and conversions.

Week 2: Data Distribution and Variable Classification

-Assessed data distributions, finding that:

Conversions were non-normal. Clicks followed a normal distribution. Classified variables as quantitative, qualitative, continuous, or discrete for better clarity and preparation for analysis.

Week 3: Hypothesis Testing

-Formulated a hypothesis: “Conversions will be higher on Facebook compared to AdWords.”

-Conducted statistical tests, revealing:

Facebook significantly outperformed AdWords in conversions (p-value << 0.05).

Supported the alternative hypothesis, confirming the difference in platform effectiveness.

Week 4: Regression Modeling and Final Insights

-Built a simple linear regression model to predict conversions based on ad clicks.

-Identified a strong positive relationship between Facebook ad clicks and conversions.

-Insights and Recommendations:

Shift budget allocation from AdWords to Facebook campaigns.

Focus on click-optimized Facebook campaigns to maximize conversions.

Key Findings

-Facebook significantly outperforms AdWords in driving conversions.

-A strong correlation exists between ad clicks and conversions, enabling reliable prediction.

-Budget reallocation to Facebook campaigns can substantially increase sales and ROI.
